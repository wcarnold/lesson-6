        <h2>About Wendi</h2>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wcarnold/lesson-5/master/wendi.jpg" width="110" height="150" alt="Selfportrait of a young woman with blonde hair and blue eyes." class="center">
        <p>I was born in California, however, after turning 7 years old, my parents and I moved to Bozeman, Montana. I grew up with two very strict parents that encouraged me to excel in school
        and participate in many after school activiteis.</p>
        <p>Due to this, I become involved in volleball, basketball, track and skiing. I grew up with a lot of school spirit and drive. Summers in Montana were my favorite.
        My mom was a teacher and my dad retired early, which left summers wide open. I'll never forget my great memories of flyfishing and camping all summer long.</p>
        <p>The way I was raised has definetly encouraged me to stay active and outdoorsey now into my adult life. I spend much of my time outdoors camping, hiking, exploring, etc with my chocolate lab, Coby.
        After earning my bachelor's degree from Arizona State University, I was tired of the desert and needed a change. One of the many reason that brought my to Washington was the beautiful weather year-round.</p>
        <p>Although I have lived in five different states and many cities, I am happy to call Seattle home.</p>
